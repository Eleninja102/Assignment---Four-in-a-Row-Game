# Assignment - Four in a Row Game

## Desciption 
This is a local multiplayer Four in a Row game built by me for a Software Engineering 2 class. It includes the ability to load various board game states using a navabar. It uses a math formula I generated when I couldn't sleep to check if someone won or not.
